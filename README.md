# My Blog (Beginner MERN Project)

Find my minimal musings here: https://blog.locrian24.now.sh

### Disclaimer

I built this as a way to become familiar with **MERN** stack _(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node)_. I never really intended this to be my own personal blog. However, I do have it on my ever increasing list of things-to-do to start adding postings about things I learn during my random programmings.

## What I Learned
This application was my first experience with MongoDB and React. 

I genuinely enjoyed working with a NoSQL database so much that, to the horror of future me, I forgot to realise the importance of showing that I do actually know SQL for an entire summer's worth of projects. Even still, I'm happy I spent the time to learn a new technology.

React showed me the whole next level past the simple HTML/CSS I did in high school. Very very interesting and plan on using it in all my future project's frontends (might still dabble with Vue)
